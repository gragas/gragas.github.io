## Current Research

This is of things that I am currently investigating. Each thing currently remains unpublished.

* [The Strong Programming Language](/strong-lang)

## Research Ideas

* Type-Safe Macros
* Explicit Mutability
   * How does forcing users to specify mutability affect
      * Productivity
      * Program safety
      * Program correctness
      * Ability to reason about programs (non-concurrent and concurrent)
* Dealing with scope
   * Investigate ways to deal with memory other than traditional GC and tradition malloc/free

## Publications

I have not yet published any work. I hope to one day.
