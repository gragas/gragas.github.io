* [JFK Moon Speech](http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm)
   * [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuW4oGKzVKc)
   * My favorite part: *We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.*
* [A Business Man Looks At Communism](http://digilib.usm.edu/cdm/ref/collection/manu/id/1420) [undated] by Fred C. Koch
   * This is an extremely important, yet greatly overlooked, artifact of a man who has undoubtedly shaped the course of America since the 1950s.
   * Fred Koch founded the oil refinery firm that later became Koch Industries. Shortly before publishing this pamphlet, Koch traveled to the Soviet Union to build oil refinery stations. There, he witnessed first-hand the atrocities of Stalin and other aspects of Soviet life in the 1940s. Koch came back to the US. Soon after, he founded the John Birch Society and published this pamphlet.
   * The affects of Fred Koch are still directly felt all over the world. Koch Industries is the second largest privately-owned company in America. The Koch brothers—David and Charles—control this company, and donate heavily to conservative, republican, and libertarian causes.
* [The FBI's Approach to the Cyber Threat](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-fbis-approach-to-the-cyber-threat) [2016] by James Comey, FBI Director
* [Fractured Lands: How the Arab World Came Apart](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/11/magazine/isis-middle-east-arab-spring-fractured-lands.html) [2016] by Scott Anderson
   * It should be noted that this journalism was funded by one of the largest liberal media companies in the world, just months before the 2016 United States presidential election.
