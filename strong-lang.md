## Introduction

It seems that it is a coming-of-age tradition for aspiring PL researchers to write their own Lisp. I suppose that I am upholding that tradition, and, like many of my peers, I think I can bring something to the table that's *different* than all the restâ€”something novel and maybe even useful. Behold, my dearest creation: *The Strong Programming Language*.

I am writing the language in an attempt to research one problem: metaprogramming. Specifically, I want to investigate whether it is possible to have the benefits of both a static type system (with much of the language's overheads resolved at compile time) and the ability to easily program the language (to metaprogram). A second constraint I want to impose is the ability to easily interface with other languages, especially C and Rust.

Many papers, texts, and articles have influenced how I approach the implementation of this language. Extremely influential has been [this article about metaprogramming](http://notes.willcrichton.net/the-coming-age-of-the-polyglot-programmer/) by Will Crichton ([here's his second post in the series](http://notes.willcrichton.net/rust-the-new-llvm/)). You can find a list of all the PL readings that have influenced me [here](/pl-readings), and a list of resources I have used [here](/pl-resources).
