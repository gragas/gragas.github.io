How do you remember to bring back what you've learned?

Terence --- Oh that's a good question, that's an important question, that's a
key question. [Roland Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_L._Fischer),
who was a great psychedelic researcher with
[psilocybin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and later retired to
[Majorca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorca) to be
[Robert Graves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Graves)' nextdoor neighbor,
coined the phrase "State Bounded". This means you can't bring it back. And I'm
sure you've all had the experience of dreaming—being caught up in some
incredible dream with strange people, foreign countries, exotic costuming, the
alarm goes off, and as you stagger out of bed, this is just melting like an
ice cube in a blast furnace. And by the time you're out of bed and fully
dressed, you have nothing. Not a hint, not a shred, not a clue. It's absolutely
gone. This is a state-bounded memory. Chemically what's going on is apparently
short-term memory transcription is just not occuring. You're having the
immediate impression of these things happening, and then it's not "going to
disk" so to speak. It's just lost.

*Audience member says something essentially inaudbile*

Terence --- And the dream is not lost, when you wake up and it melts away, and
the proof of this (and I'm sure you've all had this experience), is then you
go about your daily business, and then there will be—and it's almost always
by coincidence—an image, a chance phrase, a view of a street or something, and
it will cause you to remember the dream, and once you get a hook into the
portion of the dream, if you then work on it, you can probably bring a lot of
it out. How this works in psychedelics is if I have an insight or something
that I particularly want to remember, first of all I will say it aloud. This is
 strong imprinting. And then the real imprinting is to repeat it a few minutes
later, and then a few minutes later again. And if you carry it over a number of
minutes to several different levels, it won't leave you. A very useful shortcut
for this, is a tape recorder. Where if you play the tape of the trip back after
the trip, you will—a certain, just a phrase—will set off a chain of associative
recall and you will retain it this way. But to my mind, this is what shamanic
training must really be—is mnemonic training. If you want to bring this stuff
back you have to train yourself to bring it back. Now this state-bounded thing,
it's important to notice. We talk about how dreams are state-bounded, how
psychedelic experiences are state-bounded, but what we fail to notice usually,
is that ordinary reality is state-bounded. I mean, if I were to ask any one of
you, what did you discuss with the person you had lunch with yesterday? It's
probably very touch and go, to actually put this together. I had lunch
yesterday with Richard. We discussed his television transmission system. But
that was new to me, and therefore easier for me to retain, and also Richard and
I haven't had thousands of hours of conversation together. But, the person we
are most familiar with is ourselves. Well, I don't know if it works for you like
this, but I am let us say cleaning my house, vaccuuming, doing my dishes, making
beds, and I'm thinking—all the time—thinking. And, I understand why Rome fell,
I realize what I said wrong to somebody two weeks ago, I recall a telephone
obligation that I have to fulfill, I think about things that have happened years
and years ago. And then the doorbell rings and I go to the door and there's
someone there and they say "What are you doing?" and I say "Nothing." This is
because the ordinary state of conciousness is highly state-bounded. One thing
these Buddhists have certainly gotten right is attention to attention is the key
to taking control of your mental life. And for most of it, it's just like a
river flowing by, and every once and a while we check to see if the river is
still flowing by, but we don't attempt to retain it. So, memory training is
great psychedelic training. And of course, as I'm sure you know, there were arts
of memory in the past. We are very poor memorizers. Because we rely on
technologies to do it for us. But people in the past had all kinds of
things for allowing them to remember things. For instance, the most common one
in use in late antiquity and up through the renaissance was the memory palace
approach. This is where you think of a place, a big place preferably, a place
you know well—a school, a hospital, a cathedral, a university—but big, and sit
and think about it. Think about how it looks as you go through the main doors
and what you see when you turn to the left and what you see when you turn to the
right. Learn this building until you really can command it with reasonable
vividness in most situations. Then, if you want to remember something, imagine
yourself walking through the front door of this building, turning to your left,
and there near the water fountain, you will place an emblem of this thing you
want to remember. And then you will go down the hall and around the corner, and
by the fire extinguishers, you will place another emblem of the next thing you
want to remember. Well then, the act of remembering this long list of things is
the act of mentally moving through this imaginary building that you know, and
when you come to the water fountain, the clue will be there. When you pass the
fire extinguishers in your mind, the emblem you placed will be there. Now I know
this sounds highly unworkable and unwieldy. But it actually is extremely
workable and people like [Catallus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus) and
[Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero), the great Roman orators, were
able to speak for hours on end with lists of virtues and vices and
interconnecting causes and this sort of thing, because they were masters of this
sort of mnemonic memory palace technique. Well, psychedelics are a vivid—and
this is another of one of these things like mantras, yantras, and so forth, that
works on psychedelics—you can do this. So when you're on a psychedelic and you
have something you want to remember, place it in your memory palace. And the
next time you come past that point in your memory palace, this thing will be
there. Now the other trick is, if any of you are interested in this, the last
word is [*The Art of Memory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Memory)
by Frances Yates, who is a wonderful woman, a great scholar of renaissance
magic, and the final trick is to make the memory—the image—extremely vivid, so
that for instance if you're about to give a speech to your collegium on the
Seven Deadly Sins, well, then one of these sins is lust (I chose the easy one
because I can't remember what the other six are, shows you where my problem
lies), you don't just place the word "lust" in the memory keeping spot, you
place some vivid and shocking image (Yates suggests the image of a nun lifting
her skirt, I think this was a clasically suggested one that people were taught
to use), well then, you come around the corner, you meet the nun lifting her
skirt and you think "Aha, lust, that's the first one" and then you go on and
so forth. And books, some of the most astonishing products of the medieval
engravers' art are these books of what are called emblemata. Emblemata are
surreal juxtapositions of things and animal parts and bodies and machines that
are memory emblems, made as grotesque, surreal, and bizzare as possible, in
order to make them unforgettable. And the surrealists used this, very
conciously. And there is something about the unexpected, the grotesque, and the
surprising, that is almost by definition memorable. And this will work very well
in the psychedelic state as well.
