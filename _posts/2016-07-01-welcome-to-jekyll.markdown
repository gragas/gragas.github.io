Hello.

This website is a collection of everything that has influenced [me](/about): essays, people, places, and personal experiences and interests. Much of the content is focused on what I've learned and how I strive to live my life.

The way I live has been heavily influenced by many people—most recently, by my brother. Both of us *actively* seek to improve our lives and acheive our goals. I think many people claim to do these things as well, but few succeed. My brother and I push each other; we feed off each other. We constantly seek out new opportunities to better ourselves. The point of this website is to share what I've learned with the world—to mutually improve.

You can find my collection of readings [here](/readings) and my collection of [resources](/resources) here.
