My name is Thomas Fischer. I was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I suck at a lot of things (like writing), but I'm constantly trying to learn and better myself.

My main technical interests lie in computer science. Specifically, in programming language theory. I have a collection of readings on the subject [here](/pl-readings). One day, you might find some essays authored by me on that page.

I have some industry experience: I've professionally developed software with Python at [Rockwell Collins](http://rockwellcollins.com) and Clojure at [Sandia National Laboratories](http://sandia.gov). This fall, I will be a Go developer (intern) at [CoreOS](http://coreos.com) in San Francisco, California.

I currently attend [UIUC](http://cs.illinois.edu), where I study computer science. I am tentatively set to graduate in the spring of 2018. This is where I fell in love with programming language theory after taking Mattox Beckman's class on the subject (CS 421).

Most of my aspirations center around computer science, though other than that they have little to do with each other: I want to start a startup. I want to get a PhD in computer science (in PL theory) from a place like [MIT](http://projects.csail.mit.edu/pl/), [Harvard](http://pl.seas.harvard.edu/), or [CMU](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/pop/), among many others. I want to teach computer science among other things.

At the moment, я знаю a fair amount of Russian, though I'm better at reading and listening than writing and speaking. I'm trying to expand my Russian vocabulary and solidify my grammar skills. I read and listen to [*Эхо Москвы*](http://echo.msk.ru) every day, and watch classic русские мультики like [*Простоквашино*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXD3txG2bVQ) and [*Карлсон Который Живёт на Крыше*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZTjr-DN9xY).
