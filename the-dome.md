This page has everything to do with mushrooms, magic, alchemy, shamanism, novelty, infinity, ...

I don't believe the field I'm trying to pinpoint has a name. Large parts of it are awash in psuedoscience. Nevertheless, it has always captured my attention. Newton was absorbed in alchemy, though he still made great contributions to the hard sciences. The collection of readings found here should at least serve to feed an imagination hungry for fantasy, alchemy, and those things closest to real magic.

## People

* [Terence McKenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna)
   * **First Paragraph from Wikipedia**: *Terence Kemp McKenna (November 16, 1946 – April 3, 2000) was an American ethnobotanist, mystic, psychonaut, lecturer, author, and an advocate for the responsible use of naturally occurring psychedelic plants. He spoke and wrote about a variety of subjects, including psychedelic drugs, plant-based entheogens, shamanism, metaphysics, alchemy, language, philosophy, culture, technology, environmentalism, and the theoretical origins of human consciousness. He was called the "Timothy Leary of the '90s", "one of the leading authorities on the ontological foundations of shamanism", and the "intellectual voice of rave culture".*
   * **My View**: Terence is by far my favorite character in this field. Simplying reading and listening to everything he contributed is a very daunting task. Listening to his talks is *almost* like directly plugging in to *the source*: the density of information is unbelievable. I recommend applying the three-read approach to all of his talks. Listen once for a great overview of what you're about to learn, making note of what to pay more attention to next time. A few days later listen again, delving a bit deeper into detail and reëxploring what you made note of last time. Finally, listen to the talk a third time, trying to understand each and every concept, reference, idea.
